## Introduction

This is a tutorial to make a minimum viable participatory mapping project. Participatory mapping, also known as community-based mapping, is a general term that refers to the process of creating maps by, for, or with local communities, often in collaboration with specialists. It allows local communities to represent their own perceptions, knowledge, and experiences about their environment. The aim is to produce a map that combines local knowledge with spatial data to support decision-making processes. These maps can be used for a variety of purposes, such as natural resource management, land use planning, or advocacy for land rights.

 With this project, users can contribute their local knowledge by clicking on a map, inputting their information, and seeing their input represented as a red dot. Existing contributions can be viewed in a similar manner. While this basic model offers fundamental functionality, it can be tailored or expanded to suit different participatory mapping initiatives. This approach can be particularly beneficial for digital geographers who want to kick-start their own participatory mapping projects. Examples of such initiatives include "Shifting LGBTQ+ Spaces", "Archiving the CHOP", and "Queering the Map".

Here are a few prerequisites to follow this tutorial. You should have:

- A basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
- Familiarity with the command line, Node.js, and the PostgreSQL database,
- Some experience with open source web mapping, and
- Accounts on Github and Heroku, and be willing to pay $20 for the Heroku service.

If you are not familiar with these topics, you can find many tutorials online. For example, [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) provides a comprehensive introduction to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. [The Command Line Crash Course](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendixa.html) is a good place to start learning the command line. [The Node.js Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/nodejs/index.htm) is a good place to start learning Node.js. [The PostgreSQL Tutorial](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/) is a good place to start learning PostgreSQL. [The  MapLibre GL JS Docs](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js-docs/api/) is a good place to start learning Leaflet. [The Github Tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) is a good place to start learning Github. [The Heroku Tutorial](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs) is a good place to start learning Heroku. If you believe you are ready, let's get started!

If you want to learn how the system works, please start with **Step one**, if you just want to build your own participatory mapping project, please start with **Step two**.


## fork the participatory mapping project to your own github account


## Clone the forked repository to your local machine

## Open the repository in VS Code.

##




## Step 1: Create a Github Repository

Above all, you will need a github repository to manage your project. Before you start, you need a GitHub account. If you don't have one, go to https://github.com/ and sign up for a new account.

Here is a step-by-step guide to creating a new repository named "participatory-mapping" on GitHub:

1.	Log into your GitHub account. Go to https://github.com/ and enter your username (or email address) and password.

2.	Create a new repository. On the upper-right corner of the screen, next to your avatar or identicon, click the '+' icon and select "New repository".

3.	Name your repository. Enter the name of your repository as "participatory-mapping". Remember, repository names should be short and memorable. You can choose to make your repository either public or private.

4.	Provide a description. In the "Description" box, you can write a short description of your project. For example, "This repository is for a participatory mapping project".

5.	Initialize your repository. If you want to start with a README file (which you should, it's a good practice to have documentation), tick the checkbox that says "Initialize this repository with a README". This file is a form of documentation. It's where you can provide an extensive description of the project, installation steps, usage, contribution guidelines, and more. Markdown language is used to style and format these files.

6.	Add a license and .gitignore (Optional). Adding a license is a good practice because it tells others how they can legally use your project. If you want to add a license, click on "Add a license" and choose the one you prefer. If you know there are specific files that you want Git to ignore when it's tracking changes, you can add a .gitignore file. Click on "Add .gitignore" and select the programming language, or the type of files you want to ignore.

7.	Create repository. Once everything is filled in, click on "Create repository" at the bottom of the page.
Congratulations! You now have a new GitHub repository named "participatory-mapping". You can start adding files, collaborating with others, and managing your new project.
