## Introduction

This is a tutorial to make a minimum viable participatory mapping project. Participatory mapping, also known as community-based mapping, is a general term that refers to the process of creating maps by, for, or with local communities, often in collaboration with specialists. It allows local communities to represent their own perceptions, knowledge, and experiences about their environment. The aim is to produce a map that combines local knowledge with spatial data to support decision-making processes. These maps can be used for a variety of purposes, such as natural resource management, land use planning, or advocacy for land rights.

 With this project, users can contribute their local knowledge by clicking on a map, inputting their information, and seeing their input represented as a red dot. Existing contributions can be viewed in a similar manner. While this basic model offers fundamental functionality, it can be tailored or expanded to suit different participatory mapping initiatives. This approach can be particularly beneficial for digital geographers who want to kick-start their own participatory mapping projects. Examples of such initiatives include "Shifting LGBTQ+ Spaces", "Archiving the CHOP", and "Queering the Map".

Here are a few prerequisites to follow this tutorial. You should have:

- A basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
- Familiarity with the command line, Node.js, and the PostgreSQL database,
- Some experience with open source web mapping, and
- Accounts on Github and Heroku, and be willing to pay $20 for the Heroku service.

If you are not familiar with these topics, you can find many tutorials online. For example, [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) provides a comprehensive introduction to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. [The Command Line Crash Course](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendixa.html) is a good place to start learning the command line. [The Node.js Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/nodejs/index.htm) is a good place to start learning Node.js. [The PostgreSQL Tutorial](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/) is a good place to start learning PostgreSQL. [The Leaflet Tutorial](https://leafletjs.com/examples.html) is a good place to start learning Leaflet. [The Github Tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) is a good place to start learning Github. [The Heroku Tutorial](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs) is a good place to start learning Heroku. If you believe you are ready, let's get started!
