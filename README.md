## Introduction
This is a minimum viable participatory mapping project. Users can contribute their local knowledge by clicking on the map, submitting their information, and seeing it represented as a red dot. Existing contributions can also be viewed as red dots. While this map offers basic functionality, it can be expanded or repurposed for various participatory mapping projects. SO, this map can help digital geographers to create a participatory mapping project by themselves.  Examples include Shifting LGBTQ+ spaces, Archiving the CHOP and Queering the Map. To follow this tutorial, you need to have some fundamental knowledge relevant to web mapping, including:

- A basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
- A basic understanding of the command line, Node.js, and PostgreSQL database,
- Some open source mapping experience, and
- A github account, a heroku account, and be willing to pay $20 for the heroku service.
